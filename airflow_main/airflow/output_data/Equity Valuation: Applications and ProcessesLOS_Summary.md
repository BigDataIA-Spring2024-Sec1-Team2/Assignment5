 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach in finance is a method used to determine the value of a company's equity by discounting the future free cash flows available to the equity holders. The ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach lies in the fact that it focuses on the cash flows available specifically to the equity shareholders after accounting for all expenses, investments, and debt obligations. This approach highlights the cash flows that belong to the equity holders as owners of the company, emphasizing their claim on the residual value of the business after all other stakeholders have been paid.

 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand the adjustments needed to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) from various financial metrics. This includes adjusting net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to arrive at FCFF and FCFE.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes from the reading are:

1. Calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
2. Calculate Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes for forecasting Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) include describing different approaches for forecasting these two important financial metrics. These approaches can involve projecting future cash flows, considering various financial and operating factors, and utilizing different forecasting methods to estimate FCFF and FCFE accurately.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model and the Dividend Discount Models. The FCFE model focuses on the cash flows available to equity shareholders after accounting for reinvestment needs, while the Dividend Discount Models value a stock based on the present value of expected future dividend payments. Both models are used in equity valuation, but they approach valuation from different perspectives.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE

Sensitivity analysis helps in assessing how changes in key input variables impact the calculated FCFF and FCFE values. By varying one variable at a time while keeping others constant, sensitivity analysis provides insight into the potential impact of different scenarios on the valuation results.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model
