 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach focuses on the perspective of equity holders in a company by calculating the cash flows available to shareholders after all expenses and reinvestment needs have been accounted for. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding how much cash is available to be distributed to shareholders after taking into consideration the company's operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt obligations. By using the FCFE approach, investors can gain insights into the financial health of a company from an ownership perspective.

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model and the Dividend Discount Model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand how various corporate actions such as dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage can impact future Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the evaluation of using net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation purposes.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The reading covers the different types of Free Cash Flow (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) models, including:

1. Single-stage (stable-growth) model: This model assumes that the company will have a constant growth rate in perpetuity. The formula for this model is:
   \[FCFF = (1 - Tax Rate) \times (EBIT \times (1 - Tax Rate)) + Depreciation - CapEx - Change in NWC\]
   \[FCFE = FCFF - Interest \times (1 - Tax Rate) + Net Borrowing\]

2. Two-stage model: This model assumes that the company will have two different growth rates over a specified period before reaching a  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s) 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome from the reading is understanding the use of sensitivity analysis in Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) valuations. Sensitivity analysis involves examining how changes in key input variables, such as revenue growth rate, discount rate, or terminal value, impact the calculated value of FCFF and FCFE. This analysis helps in assessing the impact of uncertainty and variability in these inputs on the overall valuation results.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes from the reading are focused on understanding and describing the approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.
