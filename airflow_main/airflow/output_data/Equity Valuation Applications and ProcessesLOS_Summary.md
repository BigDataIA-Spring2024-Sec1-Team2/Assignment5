 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach is based on the ownership perspective, which considers equity investors as the owners of the firm. This approach focuses on the cash flows available to equity shareholders after accounting for reinvestment needs and debt payments, emphasizing the cash flows that are available to the equity holders. By looking at FCFE, investors can assess the cash flows that are truly attributable to them and evaluate the firm's value from an ownership standpoint.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on explaining the appropriate adjustments needed to calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) from various financial metrics. These adjustments involve modifying net income, Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), and Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) to accurately determine the cash flows available to both the firm and equity holders.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
1. Calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) which is calculated as:
   \[
   FCFF = EBIT(1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation - Capex - Change in Net Working Capital
   \]
2. Calculate Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) which is calculated as:
   \[
   FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation - Capex - Change in Net Working Capital + Net Borrowing
   \]  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
- Forecasting Free Cash Flows to the Firm (FCFF) using various approaches.
- Forecasting Free Cash Flows to Equity (FCFE) using different methods.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes from the reading are as follows:

- Comparing the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model with the Dividend Discount Model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes focus on understanding how certain financial decisions, such as dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage, can impact future Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). These decisions can influence the cash flow available to both equity and debt holders of a company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the evaluation of using net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses different types of Free Cash Flow (FCF) models for valuation, including:

1. Single-stage (stable-growth) model: This model assumes constant growth in cash flows indefinitely.
2. Two-stage model: This model assumes two different growth rates for cash flows over different time periods.
3. Three-stage model: This model assumes three different growth rates for cash flows over different time periods.

The appropriate model to use for valuing a company depends on the company's characteristics, such as its growth prospects, industry dynamics, and market conditions. It is important to select a model that best reflects the company's expected cash flow patterns and growth trajectory.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s) 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand the importance and application of sensitivity analysis in valuing a company using Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) methods. Sensitivity analysis helps in assessing the impact of changes in key variables, such as revenue growth rate, discount rate, and terminal value, on the valuation of a company. By conducting sensitivity analysis, analysts can better understand the range of possible outcomes and the level of risk associated with their valuation estimates.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on describing approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model. 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand and assess whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued using a free cash flow valuation model.
