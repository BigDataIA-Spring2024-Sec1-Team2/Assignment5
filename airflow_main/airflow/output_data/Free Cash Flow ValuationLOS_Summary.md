 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
- Calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain fundamental determinants of residual income 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to explain the fundamental determinants of residual income.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the relationship between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals. Residual income valuation is a method used to estimate the value of a company by considering the excess of its earnings over the cost of equity. The justified price-to-book ratio is calculated by dividing the forecasted book value of equity by the forecasted book value of equity per share. The reading likely explores how these two valuation methods are connected and how they can be used to analyze and determine the appropriate price of a stock.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The key learning outcomes from the reading are as follows:

1. Calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock using the single-stage (constant-growth) residual income model.
2. Interpreting the intrinsic value derived from the single-stage model.
3. Calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock using the multistage residual income model.
4. Interpreting the intrinsic value derived from the multistage model.

These outcomes focus on understanding and applying different models to determine the intrinsic value of a common stock.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome from the reading is to calculate the implied growth rate in residual income using the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on explaining continuing residual income and justifying an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon based on company and industry prospects.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company’s common stock 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes from the reading are:

1. Explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models
2. Justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company’s common stock  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe accounting issues in applying residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to be able to describe accounting issues in applying residual income models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model. 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome from the reading is to understand how to use a residual income model to assess whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued.
