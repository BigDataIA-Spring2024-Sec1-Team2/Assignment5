 **LOS**: The member should be able to: calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market value added 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on the ability to calculate and interpret three key performance measures: 
1. Residual income
2. Economic value added (EVA)
3. Market value added  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe the uses of residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading material is to understand and describe the uses of residual income models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:

1. Calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model.
2. Compare value recognition in residual income model with other present value models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain fundamental determinants of residual income 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to explain the fundamental determinants of residual income.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the relationship between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals. It explains how residual income valuation involves calculating the present value of future residual income, which is the income that exceeds the cost of equity. The justified price-to-book ratio, on the other hand, is calculated by dividing the present value of future residual income by the book value of equity. This relationship helps investors understand how the market is valuing a company relative to its book value and expected future earnings.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes discussed in the reading are:

1. Calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using a single-stage (constant-growth) residual income model.
2. Interpret the intrinsic value calculated using single-stage residual income model.
3. Calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using a multistage residual income model.
4. Interpret the intrinsic value calculated using multistage residual income model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to calculate the implied growth rate in residual income by using the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading material include:

1. Understanding and explaining continuing residual income.
2. Justifying an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon based on company and industry prospects.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a companyâ€™s common stock 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are:
- Explaining the strengths and weaknesses of residual income models
- Justifying the selection of a residual income model to value a company's common stock  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe accounting issues in applying residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on understanding and describing accounting issues related to applying residual income models in the context of financial analysis and valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model. 
 
 **Summary**: The main focus of the reading is on using a residual income model to assess the valuation of a stock. This involves evaluating whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on the residual income generated by the stock.
