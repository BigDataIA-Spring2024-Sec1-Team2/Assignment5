11,"Question 1:
John is a financial analyst assessing the valuation of a company's equity. He believes that the company may be undervalued based on his discounted cash flow analysis. What approach is John most likely using if he is valuing the company's equity by estimating the present value of future free cash flows and subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital?
A. FCFF model
B. FCFE model
C. Dividend discount model","wer: B
Explanation: John is most likely using the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model since he is valuing the equity by estimating the present value of future FCFE. The FCFE model is used to value the equity of a company by discounting the future cash flows available to common shareholders. This approach considers the cash flows available for distribution to common shareholders after accounting for essential expenditures and financial obligations.

Question 2:
Lisa, a financial analyst, wants to use a valuation model that aligns with the company's capacity to pay dividends. The company she is analyzing pays dividends at a much lower rate than its actual capacity. Which free cash flow approach is Lisa most likely to use in this scenario?
A. FCFE model
B. Residual income model
C. FCFF model"
12,"21. What is the fundamental concept behind residual income models in equity valuation?

A. Residual income reflects net income remaining after accounting for all capital costs.

B. Residual income considers only common shareholders' opportunity cost.

C. Residual income excludes the cost of debt capital.","wer: A

Explanation: The fundamental concept of residual income models is that residual income represents the net income available to common shareholders after deducting the opportunity cost of all capital employed in generating that income. It explicitly accounts for the costs of all capital used in generating income, unlike traditional accounting measures that may overlook the cost of equity capital. Residual income models aim to measure economic profit by considering all costs of capital."
13,"How is residual income calculated in the context of equity valuation?

A. Net income minus a deduction for the cost of equity capital.

B. Net income plus a deduction for the cost of debt capital.

C. Gross income minus operating expenses.","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income in equity valuation is calculated as net income minus a deduction for the cost of equity capital. This deduction, known as the equity charge, is the equity capital multiplied by the required rate of return on equity (i.e., the cost of equity capital in percentage terms). Residual income represents the economic profit generated by a company over and above the cost of all capital employed."
14,"How does residual income valuation differ from traditional accounting measures like net income?

A. Residual income accounts for the cost of all capital, while net income does not.

B. Residual income is based on economic profit, while net income is a straightforward accounting measure.

C. Residual income values equity more accurately than net income.","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income valuation differs from traditional accounting measures like net income in that residual income explicitly incorporates the costs of all capital used in generating income, including the cost of equity capital. Net income, on the other hand, focuses solely on the company's accounting profit without considering the opportunity cost of equity capital. Residual income provides a more accurate measure of economic profit and value creation for shareholders."
15,"In the context of residual income models, what is the significance of the required rate of return on equity (cost of equity capital)?

A. It determines the deduction applied to net income to calculate residual income.

B. It represents the cost of debt capital for the company.

C. It is used to calculate the company's gross profit margin.","wer: A

Explanation: The required rate of return on equity (cost of equity capital) is a critical factor in residual income models. It is used to calculate the deduction applied to net income to derive the residual income available to common shareholders. The required rate of return on equity reflects the minimum return shareholders expect to compensate them for the risk of holding equity in the company. A higher cost of equity capital results in a larger deduction from net income, leading to lower residual income."
16,"How is residual income used in estimating the intrinsic value of common stock?

A. It is added to the current book value per share to derive the intrinsic value.

B. It is multiplied by the stock's market price to determine its fair value.

C. It is discounted to present value and added to the book value per share to estimate intrinsic value.","wer: C

Explanation: In estimating the intrinsic value of common stock using residual income models, the future stream of residual income is calculated, discounted to its present value using the required rate of return on equity, and then added to the current book value per share. The intrinsic value of a share of stock is the sum of the book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. This approach accounts for expected future profits beyond the current accounting book value."
17,"What is the implication of a positive residual income for a company's valuation?

A. Positive residual income indicates the company is creating value for shareholders.

B. Positive residual income suggests the company is experiencing financial distress.

C. Positive residual income is irrelevant for valuation purposes.","wer: A

Explanation: A positive residual income indicates that a company is generating economic profit and adding value for its shareholders. In the context of valuation, positive residual income suggests that the firm is earning more than its cost of equity capital, which is a favorable signal for investors. It signifies that the company's operations are generating returns above and beyond what is required to compensate providers of capital, leading to a higher estimated intrinsic value for the stock."
18,"Why is the concept of continuing residual income important in the multistage residual income model?

A. It accounts for the expected growth rate of residual income in the terminal stage.

B. It adjusts for any inconsistencies in the forecasted earnings per share.

C. It helps estimate the residual income beyond the forecast horizon.","wer: C

Explanation: Continuing residual income is crucial in the multistage residual income model as it allows for the estimation of residual income beyond the forecast horizon. By justifying an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given the company's and industry prospects, the model accounts for persistent profitability and value creation potential even after the explicit forecast period. This factor plays a significant role in determining the long-term intrinsic value of a company's common stock."
19,"How do residual income models compare to dividend discount models and free cash flow models for equity valuation purposes?

A. Residual income models consider all capital costs, while dividend discount models focus on dividend payments.

B. Residual income models emphasize economic profit, whereas free cash flow models focus on cash generation.

C. Residual income models are preferred for accounting accuracy, while free cash flow models are simpler to apply.","wer: B

Explanation: Residual income models differ from dividend discount models in that they focus on economic profit generated above the cost of all capital used, whereas dividend discount models primarily value stock based on future dividend payments. Residual income models are related to earnings-based valuation but more explicitly account for the cost of equity capital. Free cash flow models, on the other hand, focus on the cash generated by a firm's operations without considering capital costs. Each model has advantages based on the specific context and assumptions used in their application."
20,"When selecting a residual income model for valuing a company's common stock, what factors should be considered?

A. The company's capital structure and cost of debt.

B. The forecasted growth rate of future earnings per share.

C. The industry's expected rates of return and risk levels.","wer: B

Explanation: When choosing a residual income model for valuing a company's common stock, factors such as the forecasted growth rate of future earnings per share play a crucial role. The model selected should align with the growth expectations, risk profile, and valuation aims specific to the company being analyzed. Additionally, the model's ability to incorporate key fundamental determinants, such as return on equity and residual income growth, is essential for an accurate valuation assessment."
21,"What are the strengths and weaknesses of residual income models compared with other valuation methods?

A. Residual income models are less accurate than traditional discounted cash flow models.

B. Residual income models incorporate all capital costs, unlike price-earnings ratio models.

C. Residual income models can be complex to apply but can provide more accurate estimations of intrinsic value.","wer: C

Explanation: Residual income models have strengths such as explicitly accounting for all capital costs, reflecting economic profit, and providing insight into value creation by a company. However, they can be complex to apply due to the challenge of properly forecasting residual income components. In comparison to other valuation methods like dividend discount models and free cash flow models, residual income models offer a more direct link to economic profit but require a greater understanding of accounting fundamentals for effective implementation."
