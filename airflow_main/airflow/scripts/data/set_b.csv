11,"1. When valuing equity securities, analysts often use which of the following free cash flow models more frequently than others?
   A. FCFF models
   B. FCFE models
   C. Residual income approach","wer: A. FCFF models

Explanation: According to the provided knowledge base, when using discounted cash flow analysis, analysts use FCFF models roughly twice as frequently as FCFE models. FCFF models estimate the value of the firm by discounting future FCFF at the weighted average cost of capital, making them a common choice in equity valuation. FCFF provides an economically sound basis for valuation and is preferred by analysts in practice."
12,"What conditions make analysts prefer to use free cash flows (FCFF or FCFE) over dividends for valuation purposes?
   A. The company does not pay dividends
   B. The company pays significantly different dividends from its capacity
   C. Free cash flows align with profitability within a comfortable forecast period","wer: A. The company does not pay dividends

   A. Discounted Cash Flow model
   B. FCFF model
   C. FCFE model","wer: C. FCFE model

   B. By adding interest expenses and deducting depreciation and taxes
   C. By adding net borrowing and deducting operational expenses","wer: A. By adding non-cash charges and deducting capital expenditures and working capital investments

These adjustments are necessary to convert net income, a non-cash measure, into a cash flow measure that reflects the firm's actual cash-generating capability."

   A. FCFF takes a firm-wide perspective, while FCFE focuses on equity value
   B. FCFE considers free cash flow availability, while FCFF focuses on debt obligations
   C. FCFF adjusts for capital structure, while FCFE relies on cash flows to equity holders","wer: A. FCFF takes a firm-wide perspective, while FCFE focuses on equity value

17,"1. A financial analyst is asked to calculate residual income for Company X. If the net income for Company X is $1,000,000, the equity charge is $500,000, and the total capital used is $2,000,000, what is the residual income for Company X?
A. $500,000
B. $1,000,000

A. Residual income is synonymous with economic profit.
B. Economic profit is a broader concept than residual income.
