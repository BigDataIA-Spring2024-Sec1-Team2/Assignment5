B. Market multiples approach
C. Free cash flow (FCF) models","wer: C
Explanation: Analysts prefer free cash flow (FCF) models, specifically using either free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) or free cash flow to equity (FCFE), as they provide an economically sound basis for equity valuation. FCFF and FCFE represent the cash flows available for distribution to shareholders, offering a more comprehensive approach to valuation compared to DDM or market multiples."

A. By discounting the free cash flow to equity (FCFE) at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
B. By finding the present value of FCFE
C. By subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital from the value of the firm","wer: C
Explanation: Common equity can be valued indirectly using the FCFF model by first estimating the value of the firm using FCFF and then subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital, typically debt, to arrive at an estimate of the value of equity. This method allows analysts to determine the value of equity by considering the firm's overall financial structure."
13,"In FCFF valuation, what does the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represent?
A. The cost of equity for the firm
B. The discount rate for future cash flows
C. The required return on invested capital","wer: B
Explanation: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in FCFF valuation represents the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future free cash flows.

A. Net income and cash flow from operations
B. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and depreciation
C. Dividends and share repurchases","wer: A
Explanation: Analysts typically base their forecasts of future free cash flows on key financial statement components such as net income and cash flow from operations. These components provide insights into the company's profitability and ability to generate cash for distribution to shareholders."
15,"How are FCFF and FCFE related to each other in terms of calculation?
A. FCFE = FCFF - Int(1 - Tax rate) + Net borrowing
B. FCFE = FCFF + Int(1 - Tax rate) - Net borrowing
C. FCFE = FCFF - Net borrowing","wer: A
Explanation: The relationship between FCFF and FCFE is expressed as FCFE = FCFF - Int(1 - Tax rate) + Net borrowing. This equation highlights the connection between the free cash flows available to the firm (FCFF) and the free cash flows available to equity (FCFE) by incorporating interest expenses and net borrowing activities."
16,"What is the general expression for a two-stage FCFF valuation model?
A. Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t (1 + WACC) t
B. Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t (1 + WACC) t + FCFF n + 1 (WACC - g) 1 / (1 + WACC) n
C. Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t (1 + r) t + (FCFE n + 1 r - g) [1 / (1 + r) n]","wer: B
Explanation: The general expression for a two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t (1 + WACC) t + FCFF n + 1 (WACC - g) 1 / (1 + WACC) n. This model incorporates the discounted free cash flows and the terminal value calculation, considering growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)."
17,"How do analysts typically forecast future free cash flows in multistage valuation models?
A. By focusing solely on current market conditions
B. By considering variations in the company's sales and profitability
C. By relying on historical dividend payments","wer: B

These models incorporate growth projections and changes in operational aspects to estimate cash flows over different stages."
18,"In valuation analysis, what is the purpose of using sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE models?
A. To determine the terminal value of the company
B. To evaluate whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued
C. To assess the impact of variations in key input parameters on valuation outcomes","wer: C
Explanation: Sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE models serves the purpose of assessing how variations in key input parameters, such as growth rates or discount rates, impact the valuation outcomes. By conducting sensitivity analysis, analysts can gauge the sensitivity of valuation results to changes in critical assumptions."

A. Includes a charge for the cost of equity capital
B. Excludes costs of all capital used
C. Considers only net income","wer: A

A. Present value of expected future per-share residual income
B. Historical earnings per share
C. Market price-to-book ratio","wer: A

Explanation: The intrinsic value of a share of common stock in the residual income model comprises the book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. This reflects the total value shareholders can expect from holding the stock."
23,"How is residual income linked to a company's return on equity (ROE) in the valuation process?

A. Equal to the difference between ROE and required rate of return
B. Unrelated to ROE
C. Affects the cost of debt capital","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income is closely linked to a company's return on equity (ROE) as it represents the excess return above the required rate of return on equity. Residual income is calculated as the difference between actual ROE and the required ROE."

A. Expected per-share price at terminal time
B. Present value of book value per share
C. Expected future per-share earnings","wer: A

Explanation: In the two-stage residual income model with continuing residual income, the intrinsic value includes the expected per-share price at terminal time, reflecting future market expectations beyond the initial residual income calculations."

A. Focuses on economic profit after all capital costs
B. Considers only present cash flows
C. Ignores the cost of equity capital","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income valuation focuses on economic profit after accounting for all capital costs, making it a more comprehensive measure of a company's value creation for shareholders compared to models that focus solely on cash flows or dividends."
26,"When using the residual income model to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued, which factor is crucial in determining the assessment?

A. Expected residual income at the forecast horizon
B. Historical stock performance
C. Market volatility index","wer: A

Explanation: Evaluating whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued using the residual income model involves assessing the expected residual income at the forecast horizon, considering the company's future performance relative to its cost of equity and book value.
