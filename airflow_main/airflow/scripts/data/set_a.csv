A. Value per share
B. Consolidated financial statements
C. Diversification and complexity of the company's structure","wer: C

10,"In the context of discounted cash flow valuation, which of the following calculations best represents the value of equity using the FCFF valuation approach?
   A. Equity value = Firm value - Market value of debt
   B. Equity value = FCFF / WACC - g
   C. Equity value = FCFF 0 (1 + g) / (WACC - g)","wer: A

   A. Sales growth projections

   A. Callable feature
   B. Fixed-rate structure

   A. Credit spread duration
   B. Change in the default probability

   B. Market with high supply of newly issued high-yield bonds
   C. Market with high concentration of CCC-rated bonds","wer: A

17,"1. A financial analyst is using the residual income model to value a company's common stock. If a company has positive net income but does not earn more than its cost of equity capital, what does this imply about the company's value for shareholders?

A. The company is not adding value for shareholders.
B. The company is performing well compared to competitors.
C. The company is likely undervalued in the market.","wer: A

Explanation: The scenario described indicates that the company is not adding value for shareholders because, despite having positive net income, it is not earning more than its cost of equity capital. This implies that the company is not generating returns that exceed what shareholders expect as a minimum return, resulting in a lack of value creation for shareholders. Therefore, option A is the correct choice."
18,"A financial analyst is calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model. How is residual income measured in this context, and what does it reveal about the company's performance?

A. Residual income is net income minus equity charge, indicating if the company is creating value for shareholders.
B. Residual income is total assets minus total liabilities, showing the company's financial health.
C. Residual income is operating income minus interest expense, highlighting efficiency in operations.","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income, in the context of the residual income model for valuing common stock, is calculated as net income minus the equity charge. This deduction represents the opportunity cost of equity capital and helps assess whether the company is creating value for shareholders above the cost of equity. Therefore, option A accurately describes how residual income is measured and its significance in evaluating a company's performance."
19,"When comparing residual income models to dividend discount models and free cash flow models, what are the key strengths of residual income models that may justify their selection for valuing a company's common stock?

A. Residual income models explicitly account for all capital costs and are less dependent on dividend payouts.
B. Residual income models are simpler to implement and require fewer assumptions than other models.
C. Residual income models focus solely on future cash flows without considering the company's historical performance.","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income models are advantageous because they explicitly recognize all capital costs, including the cost of equity, unlike traditional dividend discount models that solely rely on dividend payouts. Residual income models, therefore, provide a more comprehensive picture of a company's value creation potential beyond just dividends. Option A correctly highlights this key strength that justifies the selection of residual income models for stock valuation."
20,"In the context of residual income valuation, how does the concept of economic profit differ from traditional accounting measures such as net income?

A. Economic profit deducts the cost of equity capital, whereas net income neglects this deduction.
B. Economic profit focuses on total revenue, while net income emphasizes operating expenses.
C. Economic profit accounts for interest expenses, unlike net income which excludes this cost.","wer: A

Explanation: The key distinction between economic profit and net income is that economic profit deducts the cost of equity capital, representing the shareholders' opportunity cost, whereas net income does not incorporate this deduction. By subtracting the equity charge, economic profit in residual income models provides a more accurate assessment of the company's true profitability from the perspective of shareholders. Option A correctly captures this fundamental difference between economic profit and net income."
21,"How does residual income valuation address the shortcomings of traditional accounting methods in assessing a company's value creation for shareholders?

A. Residual income explicitly recognizes the full economic costs of equity capital, while traditional accounting does not consider this aspect.
B. Residual income only focuses on historical financial data, unlike traditional accounting which includes forward-looking projections.
C. Residual income values a company solely based on market sentiment, while traditional accounting focuses on balance sheet metrics.","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income valuation overcomes the limitations of traditional accounting by explicitly acknowledging the economic costs of equity capital, which are crucial for assessing whether a company adds value for shareholders. Unlike traditional accounting methods that may not fully reflect the opportunity costs of capital, residual income provides a more comprehensive evaluation of a company's performance and worth to equity investors. Therefore, option A accurately describes how residual income valuation addresses the deficiencies of traditional accounting measures."
