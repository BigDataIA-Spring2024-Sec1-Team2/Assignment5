A. Comparable Company Analysis.
B. Discounted Cash Flow.
C. Price/Earnings Ratio.","wer: B
Explanation: The discounted cash flow (DCF) model is an absolute valuation model that estimates intrinsic value by discounting future cash flows. It provides a point estimate of the asset's value based on projected cash flows, making it a suitable method for determining value based on expected financial performance.","The valuation approach that a financial analyst should use to estimate the intrinsic value of a company's stock based on its future cash flows with a point estimate is B. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF).

Explanation:
1. Comparable Company Analysis (A) involves comparing the valuation multiples of comparable companies to determine the relative value of the target company. While this approach can provide useful insights, it may not directly estimate the intrinsic value of a company based on its future cash flows.

2. Price/Earnings Ratio (C) is a method of valuing a company by comparing its stock price to its earnings per share. This method does not directly consider future cash flows and may not provide an accurate estimate of intrinsic value.

3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) (B) is a valuation method that estimates the intrinsic value of a company by discounting its expected future cash flows back to their present value. This approach considers the time value of money, the risk associated with the company's cash flows, and provides a more robust estimate of intrinsic value based on the company's fundamentals.

Therefore, the financial analyst should use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to estimate the intrinsic value of the company's stock with a point estimate based on its future cash flows.",0.7251474122747306

A. Discounted dividend model (DDM)
B. Market multiples approach
C. Free cash flow (FCF) models","wer: C
Explanation: Analysts prefer free cash flow (FCF) models, specifically using either free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) or free cash flow to equity (FCFE), as they provide an economically sound basis for equity valuation. FCFF and FCFE represent the cash flows available for distribution to shareholders, offering a more comprehensive approach to valuation compared to DDM or market multiples.","1. When valuing equities, which method is preferred by analysts due to providing an economically sound basis for valuation? 

Answer: C. Free cash flow (FCF) models

Explanation: Free cash flow models are preferred by analysts due to providing an economically sound basis for valuation because they consider the cash flows available to all stakeholders, including equity investors, debt holders, and the company itself. By focusing on the actual cash generated by the business after accounting for operating expenses and investments in capital expenditures, free cash flow models offer a more comprehensive and transparent view of a company's financial performance and value. Additionally, free cash flow can be used for various purposes such as reinvestment in the business, debt repayment, dividends, or share buybacks, making it a versatile and reliable metric for valuation.",0.8378168549493472
12,"How can common equity be valued indirectly using the FCFF model?

B. By finding the present value of FCFE
C. By subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital from the value of the firm","wer: C
Explanation: Common equity can be valued indirectly using the FCFF model by first estimating the value of the firm using FCFF and then subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital, typically debt, to arrive at an estimate of the value of equity. This method allows analysts to determine the value of equity by considering the firm's overall financial structure.","The correct answer is:

C. By subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital from the value of the firm

Explanation: In the FCFF (Free Cash Flow to the Firm) model, common equity can be indirectly valued by subtracting the firm's total debt and any other non-common-stock capital (like preferred equity) from the overall value of the firm. This approach leaves the residual value to be attributed to the common equity holders, as they are the last claimants on the firm's assets after all other obligations have been settled. This method helps in determining the value of common equity based on the firm's cash flow available to all capital providers.",0.8193704867104075

A. The cost of equity for the firm
B. The discount rate for future cash flows
C. The required return on invested capital","wer: B
Explanation: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in FCFF valuation represents the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future free cash flows. It accounts for both the cost of equity and the cost of debt, reflecting the overall required return on the firm's invested capital.","B. The discount rate for future cash flows

Explanation: In FCFF (Free Cash Flow to the Firm) valuation, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents the discount rate applied to future cash flows. It is the weighted average of the cost of equity and the cost of debt, reflecting the average rate of return required by all of the firm's investors (both debt and equity holders). The WACC is used to discount the projected free cash flows to determine the present value of the firm.",0.8931841026276358
14,"When forecasting future free cash flows, analysts often base their models on which primary financial statement components?
A. Net income and cash flow from operations
B. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and depreciation
C. Dividends and share repurchases","wer: A
Explanation: Analysts typically base their forecasts of future free cash flows on key financial statement components such as net income and cash flow from operations. These components provide insights into the company's profitability and ability to generate cash for distribution to shareholders.","The correct answer is B. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and depreciation.

Explanation: When forecasting future free cash flows, analysts often base their models on components from the income statement, including Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and depreciation. EBIT is a measure of a company's profitability before taking into account interest and taxes, while depreciation represents the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives. Both EBIT and depreciation are essential in determining the operating cash flows of a company, which are crucial inputs in estimating free cash flow. Net income and cash flow from operations are important metrics but may not capture the operating cash flows as comprehensively as EBIT and depreciation do. Dividends and share repurchases, on the other hand, do not directly impact future free cash flows as they represent cash already distributed to shareholders.",0.6688663930878872
15,"How are FCFF and FCFE related to each other in terms of calculation?
A. FCFE = FCFF - Int(1 - Tax rate) + Net borrowing
B. FCFE = FCFF + Int(1 - Tax rate) - Net borrowing
C. FCFE = FCFF - Net borrowing","wer: A
Explanation: The relationship between FCFF and FCFE is expressed as FCFE = FCFF - Int(1 - Tax rate) + Net borrowing. This equation highlights the connection between the free cash flows available to the firm (FCFF) and the free cash flows available to equity (FCFE) by incorporating interest expenses and net borrowing activities.","Answer: C. FCFE = FCFF - Net borrowing

Explanation: The relationship between FCFF (Free Cash Flow to the Firm) and FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity) can be understood in terms of the formula used to calculate each. FCFF represents the cash flow available to all investors, both debt and equity holders, after operating expenses and investments are accounted for. FCFE, on the other hand, is the cash flow specifically available to equity holders after considering debt obligations and interest payments. 

Therefore, FCFE is derived from FCFF by subtracting the net borrowing, as this adjustment accounts for any additional debt financing that could impact the cash flow specifically available to equity holders. This relationship is captured by the formula FCFE = FCFF - Net borrowing, making option C the correct choice.",0.8071717190088928
16,"What is the general expression for a two-stage FCFF valuation model?
A. Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t (1 + WACC) t

C. Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t (1 + r) t + (FCFE n + 1 r - g) [1 / (1 + r) n]","wer: B
Explanation: The general expression for a two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t (1 + WACC) t + FCFF n + 1 (WACC - g) 1 / (1 + WACC) n. This model incorporates the discounted free cash flows and the terminal value calculation, considering growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).","The correct answer is B. Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t (1 + WACC) t + FCFF n + 1 (WACC - g) 1 / (1 + WACC) n

Explanation: The two-stage FCFF (Free Cash Flow to the Firm) valuation model consists of two phases: an initial high-growth phase (limited growth) followed by a terminal phase (stable growth). In the formula shown in option B, the first part of the equation calculates the present value of FCFF during the high-growth phase using the discount rate (WACC) for each period. The second part of the equation calculates the present value of the terminal value, which is the FCFF in the final year of the high-growth phase (n+1) divided by the difference between the discount rate (WACC) and the long-term growth rate (g), discounted back to the present value at the end of the high-growth phase (n). This equation represents the total firm value based on the two-stage FCFF valuation model.",0.8694881867934977

A. Charge for common shareholders' opportunity cost
B. Cost of debt capital
C. Earnings growth rates","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income is calculated as net income less a charge for common shareholders' opportunity cost in generating net income. This charge represents the cost of equity capital used by shareholders.","1. A. Charge for common shareholders' opportunity cost

Explanation: The correct answer for when using the residual income model for estimating a stock's intrinsic value is to subtract the charge for common shareholders' opportunity cost from net income to calculate residual income. This charge represents the cost of equity capital and reflects the return that shareholders could have earned in an alternative investment with similar risk. Subtracting this opportunity cost from net income helps determine whether the company is generating excess returns above what is expected by shareholders, indicating value creation. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice in the context of the residual income model.",0.7750078197542036
20,"In residual income models, what does a positive residual income indicate about a company's value for shareholders?

A. Adding value if it exceeds the cost of equity capital
B. Generating high net income
C. Having low debt capital costs","wer: A

Explanation: A positive residual income suggests that the company is adding value for shareholders by earning more than its cost of equity capital. It indicates that the company is generating profits above and beyond what shareholders require as a return on their investment.","A. Adding value if it exceeds the cost of equity capital

Explanation: A positive residual income in a residual income model indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders if it exceeds the cost of equity capital. This means that the company is generating returns above and beyond what shareholders expect to receive as a minimum return on their investment. In other words, a positive residual income above the cost of equity capital signifies that the company is adding value for its shareholders.",0.8500015838476643
21,"How does residual income differ from traditional accounting measures in evaluating a company's performance?

A. Includes a charge for the cost of equity capital
B. Excludes costs of all capital used
C. Considers only net income","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income includes a charge for the cost of equity capital, which traditional accounting measures do not. By incorporating the cost of equity, residual income provides a more comprehensive evaluation of a company's performance relative to shareholders' expectations.","A. Includes a charge for the cost of equity capital.

Explanation: Residual income differs from traditional accounting measures in evaluating a company's performance by including a charge for the cost of equity capital. Traditional accounting measures typically do not account for the cost of equity capital, which is crucial for assessing whether a company adds value for shareholders. Residual income, on the other hand, explicitly deducts the equity charge from the net income to reflect the opportunity cost of equity capital to shareholders. This approach provides a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of a company's performance and worth to equity investors, addressing the deficiencies present in traditional accounting methods. Therefore, option A is the correct choice as it accurately describes how residual income incorporates the cost of equity capital to evaluate a company's performance.",0.8999004449656072

A. Equal to the difference between ROE and required rate of return
B. Unrelated to ROE
C. Affects the cost of debt capital","wer: A

Explanation: Residual income is closely linked to a company's return on equity (ROE) as it represents the excess return above the required rate of return on equity. Residual income is calculated as the difference between actual ROE and the required ROE.","The correct answer is:

A. Equal to the difference between ROE and required rate of return

Explanation: Residual income is closely linked to a company's return on equity (ROE) in the valuation process because it is calculated as the difference between the company's ROE and the required rate of return on equity capital. If a company's ROE is higher than its cost of equity capital, it generates positive residual income, indicating that it is creating value for shareholders. On the other hand, if the ROE is lower than the cost of equity capital, the residual income would be negative, suggesting that the company is not meeting the expected return requirements of its equity investors. This relationship between ROE, cost of equity, and residual income is essential in evaluating a company's performance and its ability to generate value for shareholders.",0.818550683575237
