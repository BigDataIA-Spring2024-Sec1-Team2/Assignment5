 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on comparing two approaches to valuation: 
1. Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) 
2. Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach is based on the principle that the value of a firm is determined by the cash flows available to its equity holders after all expenses and reinvestment needs have been accounted for. This approach emphasizes the perspective of equity owners and focuses on the cash flows that are available to them for distribution, such as dividends or share buybacks. By understanding the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach, one can gain insights into how equity holders benefit from the cash generated by the firm.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:

1. Explain the appropriate adjustments to net income to calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF).
2. Explain the appropriate adjustments to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to calculate FCFF.
3. Explain the appropriate adjustments to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to calculate FCFF.
4. Explain the appropriate adjustments to cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
- Calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
- Calculate Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are:
- Approaches for forecasting Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
- Approaches for forecasting Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:

- Comparing the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model with the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). 

- Understanding the differences in how each model values a company based on cash flows or dividends.

- Analyzing the strengths and limitations of each model in estimating the intrinsic value of a company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are:

- Dividends: Payments made by a company to its shareholders out of its profits. Dividends reduce the amount of cash available for the company to reinvest in its operations, which can affect future Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).

- Share repurchases: When a company buys back its own shares from the market. This can impact future FCFF and FCFE by reducing the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share and cash flows per share.

- Share issues: When a company issues new shares to raise capital. This can affect future FCFF and FCFE by diluting ownership and potentially reducing earnings per share and cash  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on evaluating the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation. The discussion likely involves comparing and contrasting these financial metrics in terms of their relevance and accuracy in representing the cash flow of a business for valuation purposes.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are about understanding different types of free cash flow models for valuing a company based on its growth stage. The models include:

1. Single-stage (stable-growth) model: This model assumes a constant growth rate in perpetuity and is often used for mature companies with stable operations.
   
2. Two-stage model: This model incorporates two different growth rates, typically a high growth rate in the initial years followed by a lower stable growth rate. It is suitable for companies transitioning from a high-growth phase to a more stable phase.

3. Three-stage model: This model includes three different growth phases, usually high growth, moderate growth, and stable growth. It is appropriate for companies with complex growth patterns or cyclical  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s) 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand how sensitivity analysis is used in valuing a company's Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) in financial analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps assess the impact of changes in key variables or assumptions on the valuation outputs, such as the intrinsic value of a company or its stock price. By varying one input at a time while keeping others constant, sensitivity analysis allows analysts to understand the sensitivity of the valuation model to different factors and to identify the key drivers of value in the analysis.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading material focus on explaining the methods used to calculate the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model. 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on using a free cash flow valuation model to determine if a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued.
