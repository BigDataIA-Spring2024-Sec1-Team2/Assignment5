- Residual Income
- Economic Value Added (EVA)
- Market Value Added  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe the uses of residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to describe the uses of residual income models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading include:

1. Calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model
2. Comparing the value recognition in residual income model with other present value models  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain fundamental determinants of residual income 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are centered around explaining the fundamental determinants of residual income.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the relationship between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals. Residual income valuation is a method used to determine the value of a company by considering the cost of equity and the equity charge. The justified price-to-book ratio, on the other hand, compares a company's market value to its book value based on forecasted fundamentals. The reading explores how these two approaches are related and how they can be used together to assess the value of a company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading include:
- Calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock
- Interpreting the intrinsic value using single-stage (constant-growth) model
- Interpreting the intrinsic value using multistage residual income model  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to calculate the implied growth rate in residual income using the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes focus on understanding and explaining continuing residual income, as well as justifying an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon based on the prospects of the company and the industry.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare residual income models with dividend discount models and free cash flow models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a companyâ€™s common stock 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
1. Explain the strengths and weaknesses of residual income models.
2. Justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company's common stock.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe accounting issues in applying residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are related to describing accounting issues in applying residual income models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model. 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on using a residual income model to assess whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued.
