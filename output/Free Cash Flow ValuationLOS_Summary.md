- Calculate and interpret economic value added (EVA)
- Calculate and interpret market value added (MVA)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe the uses of residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to describe the uses of residual income models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes include understanding how to calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and comparing the value recognition in residual income to other present value models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain fundamental determinants of residual income 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to explain the fundamental determinants of residual income.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the connection between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio using forecasted fundamentals. Specifically, it explores how residual income valuation models can be used to determine the intrinsic value of a company's equity, which can then be compared to its book value to assess whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. This analysis helps investors make more informed decisions about buying or selling stocks based on their expected returns.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The key learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:

1. Calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the single-stage (constant-growth) residual income model.
2. Interpret the intrinsic value derived from the single-stage residual income model.
3. Calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the multistage residual income model.
4. Interpret the intrinsic value derived from the multistage residual income model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to calculate the implied growth rate in residual income using the market price-to-book ratio and the required rate of return on equity.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on understanding and explaining continuing residual income, as well as justifying an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon based on company and industry prospects.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a companyâ€™s common stock 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are:

1. Explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models.
2. Justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company's common stock.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe accounting issues in applying residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand and describe accounting issues related to applying residual income models in the context of financial analysis and valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model. 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on using a residual income model to determine the valuation of a stock. The model helps in evaluating whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by comparing its current stock price to its intrinsic value calculated using the residual income approach.
