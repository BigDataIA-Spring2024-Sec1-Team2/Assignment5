 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach and highlights the ownership perspective implicit in this method.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand how to adjust net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). Adjustments are necessary to account for non-cash expenses, changes in working capital, capital expenditures, and other items that affect cash flow available to investors and creditors.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes are related to calculating Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). These calculations are important in financial analysis and help in determining the cash flows available to a company's investors and creditors.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
- Forecasting Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)
- Forecasting Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model and the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). The FCFE model values a company based on the cash flows available to equity holders, while the DDM values a company based on the present value of expected future dividends. Both models are used in equity valuation, but they differ in their approach to determining the value of a company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The reading material discusses how various corporate finance decisions such as dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage can impact future Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). It explains the relationship between these decisions and the cash flows available to both the firm and its equity holders.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The reading covers the different types of free cash flow valuation models, including:

1. Single-stage (stable-growth) FCFF and FCFE models:
   - These models assume a constant growth rate in perpetuity after a certain point in time.
   - The formulas for the single-stage FCFF and FCFE models are:
     - FCFF = (EBIT x (1 - Tax Rate)) + Depreciation & Amortization - Change in Net Working Capital - Capital Expenditure
     - FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Change in Working Capital - Capital Expenditure + Net Borrowing

2. Two-stage FCFF and FCFE models:
   - These models  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s) 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand the importance and use of sensitivity analysis in valuing firms using Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) methods. Sensitivity analysis helps in assessing the impact of changes in key input variables, such as revenue growth rate, cost of capital, and terminal growth rate, on the valuation results. By varying these inputs and analyzing the corresponding changes in the valuation, analysts can gain insights into the key drivers of value and the level of uncertainty in the valuation estimates.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The reading material covers different approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model. 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on using a free cash flow valuation model to determine the valuation of a stock. It involves assessing whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on this model.
