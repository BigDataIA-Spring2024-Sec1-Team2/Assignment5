54,"How are Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) calculated when starting with net income?
   A. FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv, FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing
   B. FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv, FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing
   C. FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv, FCFE = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv","A
   Explanation: When starting with net income, the calculations for FCFF and FCFE are as follows: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv, and FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing. These formulas incorporate net income, non-cash charges, interest, tax considerations, and capital expenditures to derive the free cash flow metrics.

   A. External stakeholders
   B. Common stockholders
   C. Debt holders","B

   Explanation: The FCFE approach to valuation implicitly considers the ownership perspective of common stockholders. FCFE represents the cash flows available to common stockholders after all necessary expenses, reinvestments, and debt obligations are met. This approach focuses on the residual equity value that belongs to common stockholders after all other claims are satisfied."
56,"How might changes in leverage impact future free cash flows to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flows to equity (FCFE)?

   A. Leverage has no impact on FCFF or FCFE
   B. Higher leverage typically increases FCFF but decreases FCFE
   C. Higher leverage typically decreases FCFF but increases FCFE","B

   Explanation: Changes in leverage can impact FCFF and FCFE differently. Higher leverage generally increases FCFF as debt is a cheaper source of capital, thus boosting cash flows to the firm. However, higher leverage usually decreases FCFE as more cash flows are allocated to debt holders, resulting in lower residual cash available for equity holders."

   A. WACC = MV(Equity) / MV(Debt + Equity) * Cost of Equity
   B. WACC = (MV(Debt) / (MV(Debt) + MV(Equity)) * Cost of Debt
   C. WACC = (MV(Dividends) / (MV(Dividends) + MV(Stock)) * Cost of Capital","B

   Explanation: The formula for calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in a free cash flow valuation model involves taking the market value of debt divided by the sum of the market value of debt and equity, and then multiplied by the cost of debt. This formula reflects the blend of costs associated with the company's capital structure."

C. It indicates the portion of earnings retained by the company for reinvestment.","B

Explanation: Continuing residual income in a residual income model represents the residual income that the company is expected to generate beyond the forecast horizon, reflecting the ongoing value creation potential of the company."
121,"When comparing residual income models to free cash flow models in equity valuation, what is a key advantage of residual income models?

A. Residual income models are better at reflecting a company's operating cash flows.
B. Residual income models explicitly consider the cost of equity capital.
C. Residual income models rely solely on historical financial data.","B

Explanation: A key advantage of residual income models over free cash flow models is that residual income models explicitly incorporate the cost of equity capital, providing a more accurate measure of economic value added."
122,"If a company's residual income consistently falls short of the cost of equity capital, what can be inferred about the company's value creation for shareholders?

A. The company is generating economic profit for shareholders.
B. The company is not creating value for shareholders as it fails to cover its cost of equity capital.
C. The company has high operational efficiency but low financial leverage.","B

Explanation: When a company's residual income does not exceed its cost of equity capital, it implies that the company is not generating enough value to cover its cost of equity capital, potentially indicating a lack of value creation for shareholders."
123,"11. In residual income valuation, what does a positive residual income indicate about a company's performance?

    A. The company is adding value for shareholders
    B. The company's cost of equity capital is higher than its net income
    C. The company is experiencing a decline in profitability","A
    Explanation: A positive residual income signifies that the company is adding value for shareholders. It means that the company is earning more than its cost of equity capital, thus generating excess returns that benefit shareholders. This is a favorable indication of the company's performance and wealth creation for investors."
124,"How does the residual income model differ from traditional valuation methods like the price-to-earnings ratio?

    A. Residual income considers the cost of equity capital, while P/E ratio does not
    B. P/E ratio is based solely on historical earnings, while residual income looks at future earnings
    C. Residual income values a company's stock based on accounting measures, whereas P/E ratio is based on market sentiment","A
    Explanation: The key distinction is that residual income models, unlike methods such as the P/E ratio, explicitly incorporate the cost of equity capital, reflecting the opportunity cost for shareholders.

125,"When calculating intrinsic value using the residual income model, how does the required rate of return on equity (cost of equity) impact the valuation?

    A. A higher cost of equity leads to lower intrinsic value
    B. A lower cost of equity leads to higher intrinsic value
    C. Cost of equity does not affect the intrinsic value in residual income model","A
    Explanation: A higher required rate of return on equity (cost of equity) results in a lower intrinsic value in the residual income model. This is because a higher cost of equity implies a higher hurdle rate for the company to meet in generating excess returns, ultimately reducing the estimated intrinsic value of the stock."
126,"How does the residual income model incorporate growth expectations into the valuation process?

    A. By using anticipated earnings per share
    B. By considering the difference between return on equity and cost of equity
    C. By adjusting the residual income calculation based on market sentiment","B
    Explanation: The residual income model considers growth expectations by examining the difference between the company's return on equity (ROE) and the cost of equity capital. If the company's ROE exceeds the cost of equity, it implies positive residual income and potential growth, influencing the valuation of the stock."
