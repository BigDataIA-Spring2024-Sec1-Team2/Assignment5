"
10," **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach is based on the perspective that the equity holders are the residual owners of a company's cash flows after all other claims have been satisfied. This approach focuses on the cash flows available to the equity shareholders after accounting for reinvestment needs and debt holders' claims. The FCFE is calculated as:

\[
FCFE = Net Income - Net Capital Expenditure - Change in Net Working Capital + Net Borrowing
\]

This perspective underscores the idea that equity holders are entitled to the cash flows remaining after all obligations have been met, reflecting their ownership stake in the company.
