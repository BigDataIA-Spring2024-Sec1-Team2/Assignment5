 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome is to be able to compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach focuses on the perspective of equity shareholders. It calculates the cash flow available to equity shareholders after accounting for capital expenditures, debt payments, and working capital requirements. This approach emphasizes the cash flows that are attributable to equity holders and can be used to determine the value of a company's equity.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes from the reading include understanding how to adjust net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). These adjustments are important in determining the cash flows available to both debt and equity holders of a company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are related to calculating Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). The formulas for calculating these are:

1. FCFF = EBIT(1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization - Change in Net Working Capital - Capital Expenditure

2. FCFE = FCFF - Interest Expense(1 - Tax Rate) + Net Borrowing

These calculations are important for analyzing a company's financial performance and determining its ability to generate cash for its investors.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are:
- Describe approaches for forecasting Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
- Describe approaches for forecasting Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model and the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) in financial analysis.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes from the reading include understanding how different corporate actions such as dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage can impact future Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). These actions can influence the available cash flow for the company and its shareholders, affecting their investment decisions and financial performance.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on evaluating the effectiveness of using net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses different types of free cash flow models used in valuation: 
1. Single-stage (stable-growth) model
2. Two-stage model
3. Three-stage model

These models help in determining the intrinsic value of a company based on its expected cash flows. The appropriate model to use depends on the characteristics of the company being analyzed.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s) 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are related to the explanation of the use of sensitivity analysis in Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) valuations. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to understand how changes in one variable impact the overall outcome of a valuation model. By adjusting key inputs or assumptions in the FCFF and FCFE models, analysts can assess the sensitivity of the valuation to these changes, providing insights into the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the valuation. This analysis helps in understanding the impact of variations in key parameters on the valuation results, thereby enhancing the robustness of the valuation process.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome from the reading is about understanding different approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model. 
 
 **Summary**: The main learning outcome of the reading is how to determine whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued using a free cash flow valuation model.
