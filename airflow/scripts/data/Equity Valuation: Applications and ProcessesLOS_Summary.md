 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand how to make adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) in order to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
- Forecasting Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) involves estimating future cash flows available to all providers of capital, including debt and equity.
- Forecasting Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) involves estimating future cash flows available to equity investors after accounting for debt holders.
- Approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE include using historical financial data, industry analysis, macroeconomic factors, and financial forecasting models such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) or the Free Cash Flow to Equity Model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model and the Dividend Discount Model (DDM).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage can impact future Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading material focus on evaluating the effectiveness of using net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation purposes.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses different types of free cash flow models:
1. Single-stage (stable-growth) model
2. Two-stage model
3. Three-stage model

These models are used to calculate free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) based on different assumptions about the company's growth and stability. The appropriate model to use depends on the characteristics of the company in question.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s)

 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading material include understanding the use of sensitivity analysis in Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) valuations. Sensitivity analysis helps in assessing the impact of changes in key variables on the valuation outputs, such as changes in revenue growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values. This analysis allows analysts to understand the potential range of valuation outcomes based on different scenarios and assumptions.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The content discusses different approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.
