2,"In equity valuation, what does intrinsic value represent with respect to a company's operation assumptions?
A. The company's value if dissolved and assets sold individually
B. The hypothetical value of an asset given an understanding of its investment characteristics
C. The price at which an asset would change hands in an informed, non-compelled transaction","wer: B
Explanation: Intrinsic value refers to the hypothetical value of an asset given a complete understanding of its investment characteristics and business operations assumptions. It incorporates the going concern assumption, which assumes the company will continue operating for the foreseeable future."
3,"When conducting valuation, what is the purpose of sensitivity analysis and situational adjustments in converting forecasts to valuation?
A. To determine the accuracy of the valuation model
B. To evaluate potential changes in assumed inputs on the analysis outcome
C. To apply discounts for lack of marketability on asset values","wer: B
Explanation: Sensitivity analysis in valuation helps analysts understand how changes in assumed inputs would impact the analysis outcome. Situational adjustments, like control premiums and discounts, are made to reflect potential changes in the analysis output based on specific circumstances or factors."
4,"Which valuation approach involves specifying an asset's intrinsic value to compare it with market price?
A. Relative valuation models
B. Sum-of-the-parts valuation
C. Absolute valuation models","wer: C
Explanation: Absolute valuation models involve specifying an asset's intrinsic value, providing a point estimate for comparison with market price. This approach aims to estimate the true or intrinsic worth of an asset based on underlying financial and operational factors."
5,"In the valuation process, what is the primary step before forecasting company performance?
A. Selecting the appropriate valuation model
B. Understanding the business
C. Converting forecasts to a valuation","wer: B
Explanation: Understanding the business is the initial step in the valuation process, encompassing evaluations of industry prospects, competitive position, and corporate strategies. This step is crucial in accurately forecasting company performance by analyzing various business-related factors."
6,"How does the going concern value contrast with the liquidation value of a company?
A. Going concern value assumes continuous operation while liquidation value assesses asset dissolution.
B. Going concern value is based on absolute valuation models, whereas liquidation value uses relative valuation.
C. Going concern value is solely dependent on the company's market price, unlike liquidation value.","wer: A
Explanation: The going concern value assumes the company will continue operating, considering future cash flows and business viability. In contrast, the liquidation value assesses the worth of a company's assets if it were dissolved, emphasizing the immediate asset realization instead of ongoing operations."
7,"When choosing an appropriate valuation approach, what broad criteria should analysts consider?

B. Alignment with the analyst's personal investment goals
C. Consistency with the company's characteristics, available data, and valuation purpose","wer: C
Explanation: Analysts should consider criteria such as consistency with the company's characteristics, availability and quality of data, and alignment with the valuation purpose when selecting an appropriate valuation approach. This ensures that the chosen approach effectively captures the company's true value."
8,"What is one key aspect that distinguishes absolute valuation models from relative valuation models?
A. Absolute models use market multiples for comparison, while relative models rely on intrinsic value.
B. Absolute models provide a point estimate of value, while relative models assess the asset's value relative to others.
C. Absolute models are based on discounted cash flow, while relative models use earnings per share.","wer: B
Explanation: One key distinction is that absolute valuation models, such as discounted cash flow models, provide a precise estimate of intrinsic value, while relative valuation models compare the asset's value relative to similar assets or benchmarks without pinpointing an intrinsic value."
9,"1. Rob is analyzing the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model. After forecasting the earnings per share and required rate of return on equity, he needs to calculate the per-share residual income. Which of the following formulas correctly represents the calculation of per-share residual income in the residual income model?

A. Earnings per share multiplied by the required rate of return on equity.
B. Expected return on equity minus the cost of debt capital.
C. Earnings per share minus the product of required rate of return on equity and beginning book value per share.","wer: C 

Explanation: Per-share residual income in the residual income model is calculated as the difference between earnings per share and the product of the required rate of return on equity and the beginning book value per share. This represents the excess income generated beyond the cost of equity capital. It indicates how much value a company has added for common shareholders."
10,"Megan, a financial analyst, is using residual income to value a company's common stock. Which of the following statements is true about continuing residual income in the residual income model?

A. Continuing residual income estimates the future dividends of a company.
B. It represents the residual income at the forecast horizon and beyond, assuming stable returns.
C. Continuing residual income is calculated as total net income minus dividends distributed to common shareholders.","wer: B

Explanation: Continuing residual income in the residual income model represents the residual income at the forecast horizon and beyond, assuming that the company will continue to generate a consistent economic profit. It reflects the ongoing value creation potential of the company for common shareholders."
11,"Andrew is evaluating the intrinsic value of a common stock using a two-stage residual income model. In the second stage, what component is added to the basic residual income calculation to determine the total intrinsic value of the stock?

A. Expected per-share earnings at the terminal time.
B. The difference between the expected return on equity and the required rate of return on equity.
C. The excess of the terminal price over the terminal book value per share.","wer: C

Explanation: In the two-stage residual income model, the intrinsic value of a common stock includes the expected per-share earnings at the terminal time plus the difference between the terminal price and the terminal book value per share. This final stage accounts for the value beyond the forecast horizon."
12,"Sarah, a financial analyst, is comparing residual income models to dividend discount models. Which of the following statements is a strength of residual income models over dividend discount models?

A. Residual income models consider the timing and predictability of dividends.
B. Residual income models do not require assumptions about future dividend growth rates.
C. Residual income models explicitly account for the cost of equity capital.","wer: C

Explanation: A strength of residual income models over dividend discount models is that residual income models explicitly account for the cost of equity capital, reflecting the true economic costs of equity financing. This makes the valuation more robust by considering the shareholders' required return."
13,"Mark is calculating the implied growth rate in residual income for a company using the market price-to-book ratio and the required rate of return on equity. Which of the following factors influences the implied growth rate in residual income?

A. The maturity structure of the company's debt.
B. The company's asset turnover ratio.
C. The discrepancy between the market's valuation and the book value of equity.","wer: C

Explanation: The implied growth rate in residual income is influenced by the discrepancy between the market's valuation, reflected in the price-to-book ratio, and the book value of equity. This discrepancy indicates the market's expectations about the company's future growth and profitability."
14,"Tina is assessing the financial performance of a company using economic value added (EVA). Which of the following components is subtracted from net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) to calculate EVA?

A. The total capital employed.
B. The cost of equity capital.
C. The net income attributable to common shareholders.","wer: B

Explanation: In calculating economic value added (EVA), the cost of equity capital is subtracted from the net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT). EVA represents the excess returns generated after considering both operating profits and the costs of equity funds."
15,"Ryan is evaluating a company's performance using the residual income model. If the company's actual earnings per share exceed the required rate of return on equity, how would the per-share residual income be affected?

A. It would decrease, reflecting lower value addition for shareholders.
B. It would increase, indicating superior performance in excess of equity costs.
C. It would not change, as long as the net income remains constant.","wer: B

Explanation: If a company's actual earnings per share exceed the required rate of return on equity, the per-share residual income would increase. This reflects the company's ability to generate value above the cost of equity capital, leading to higher residual income for shareholders."
16,"Laura is using the residual income model to estimate the intrinsic value of a common stock with a single-stage (constant-growth) model. Which of the following factors primarily determines the future residual income in a constant-growth model?

A. The dividend payout ratio of the company.
B. The company's post-forecast return on equity.
C. The stability and growth rate of future earnings.","wer: B

Explanation: In a single-stage constant-growth residual income model, the future residual income is primarily determined by the company's post-forecast return on equity. This factor reflects the company's expected profitability and the sustainability of its value creation for shareholders."
17,"David is comparing residual income models with free cash flow models. Which of the following statements best represents a key difference between residual income and free cash flow models?

A. Residual income models focus on equity financing, while free cash flow models emphasize debt financing.
B. Residual income models measure value creation directly, while free cash flow models focus on cash flow generation.
C. Residual income models calculate intrinsic value based on future growth rates, while free cash flow models rely on historical cash flows.","wer: B

Explanation: A key difference between residual income and free cash flow models is that residual income models measure value creation directly by deducting the cost of equity capital, while free cash flow models focus on the generation and availability of cash flows for all capital providers, including debt and equity."
18,"Sophia wants to assess whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued using a residual income model. Which factor is crucial in determining the accuracy of this valuation assessment?

A. The company's earnings volatility.
B. The discount rate applied to future cash flows.
C. The consistency of the company's returns on equity.","wer: B

Explanation: The discount rate applied to future cash flows, which represents the required rate of return on equity, is crucial in determining the accuracy of the valuation assessment using a residual income model. A proper discount rate ensures that the intrinsic value estimation reflects the risk and return expectations of investors."
