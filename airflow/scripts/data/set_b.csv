10,"When calculating FCFF, which of the following components should be added back to net income?
A. Non-cash charges
B. Capital expenditures
C. Interest expense","wer: A
Explanation: In the calculation of Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF), non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization are added back to net income to reflect the cash flow available to all capital providers of the firm, including equity and debt investors."

A. Single-stage FCFF model
B. Two-stage FCFE model
C. Three-stage FCFF model","wer: C
Explanation: A three-stage FCFF model is often considered suitable for companies with fluctuating growth rates in the near future. This model accounts for changing growth patterns over different forecast periods."
12,"How would an increase in leverage most likely affect future FCFE?
A. Increase due to lower financing costs
B. Decrease due to higher interest expenses
C. Remain unchanged","wer: A
Explanation: An increase in leverage can lead to a reduction in the cost of capital, thereby increasing the future Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) due to lower financing costs for the company."

A. A stable dividend-paying company
B. A high-growth technology startup
C. A mature company with consistent free cash flows","wer: B
Explanation: High-growth, startup companies that reinvest most of their earnings and do not pay dividends are more suited for valuation using the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) approach rather than the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) which relies on dividends."
15,"How would a forecasted decrease in a company's WACC impact the valuation using the FCFF model?
A. Increase the valuation
B. Decrease the valuation
C. No impact on the valuation","wer: A
Explanation: A decrease in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) would reduce the discount rate used in the FCFF model, resulting in a higher valuation for the company since cash flows are being discounted at a lower rate."

19,"1. How is residual income defined in equity valuation models?
   A. Residual income is the net income left after deducting the cost of equity capital.
   B. Residual income is the total income earned by a company.
   C. Residual income is the income generated only from debt capital.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income in equity valuation models refers to the income that remains after accounting for the cost of equity capital. It represents the profit attributable to common shareholders after considering the opportunity cost of equity capital. By deducting the cost of equity from net income, residual income captures the value generated for equity holders beyond what is required to cover the cost of equity."
20,"How does residual income differ from traditional accounting profit in equity valuation?
   A. Residual income deducts the cost of equity capital, while traditional accounting profit does not.
   B. Residual income and traditional accounting profit are the same concept.
   C. Residual income includes all costs, whereas traditional accounting profit excludes certain expenses.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income adjusts for the cost of equity capital, which traditional accounting profit does not consider. While traditional accounting profit focuses on net income without explicitly accounting for the cost of equity funds, residual income subtracts the equity charge to provide a more accurate measure of the value added for common shareholders."
21,"How can residual income models help in estimating the intrinsic value of common stock?
   A. By explicitly recognizing the costs of equity capital.
   B. By focusing solely on the company's net income.
   C. By ignoring the impact of the cost of equity capital.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income models aid in estimating the intrinsic value of common stock by explicitly considering the costs of equity capital. By deducting the equity charge from net income, these models provide a more comprehensive assessment of the value created for shareholders, incorporating the opportunity cost of equity funds."
22,"Why is residual income considered an important indicator in equity valuation?
   A. It reflects the value generated above the cost of equity capital.
   B. It is based solely on accounting profits.
   C. It does not account for the company's capital structure.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income is crucial in equity valuation as it indicates the value created for shareholders beyond the cost of equity capital. By accounting for the full costs of generating income, including the cost of equity, residual income helps investors evaluate whether a company is adding value for shareholders."
23,"How does residual income relate to other valuation methods like price-multiple approaches?
   A. Residual income explicitly considers the cost of equity, unlike price-multiple approaches.
   B. Residual income and price-multiple approaches are interchangeable concepts.
   C. Residual income and price-multiple approaches both focus on current market prices.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income differs from price-multiple approaches by explicitly factoring in the cost of equity capital, providing a more comprehensive valuation perspective. While price-multiple approaches use market-based multiples, residual income models consider the economic profit generated for common shareholders."
24,"What role does residual income play in measuring internal corporate performance and executive compensation?
   A. Residual income can be used to evaluate internal corporate performance and determine executive compensation.
   B. Residual income is not relevant for assessing internal performance or compensation decisions.
   C. Residual income is only used for equity valuation, not for internal performance assessments.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income can serve as a measure for assessing internal corporate performance and influencing executive compensation decisions. By linking residual income to value creation and economic profit, companies can incentivize performance-aligned behaviors and reward executives based on the value added for shareholders."
25,"How can an analyst forecast per-share residual income in the residual income valuation model?
   A. By subtracting the required rate of return on equity from forecasted earnings per share.
   B. By multiplying the beginning book value per share by the difference between ROE and the cost of equity.
   C. By dividing the expected net income by the total shares outstanding.","wer: B
   Explanation: An analyst can forecast per-share residual income in the residual income valuation model by multiplying the beginning book value per share by the difference between the forecasted return on equity (ROE) and the cost of equity capital. This calculation represents the expected value generated above the cost of equity for each share."
26,"What is the intrinsic value of a common stock based on the residual income model?
   A. It is the sum of the book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income.
   B. It is calculated by multiplying the forecasted net income by the cost of equity.
   C. It is determined by the total revenues generated by the company.","wer: A
   Explanation: In the residual income model, the intrinsic value of a common stock is derived as the sum of the current book value per share and the present value of anticipated future per-share residual income. This holistic approach captures the value created for shareholders over time, incorporating the cost of equity capital."
27,"How does residual income valuation compare to dividend discount and free cash flow models?
   A. Residual income valuation explicitly accounts for the cost of equity capital.
   B. Residual income valuation focuses on short-term cash flows.
   C. Residual income valuation and dividend discount models are fundamentally different.","wer: A
   Explanation: Residual income valuation distinguishes itself by explicitly considering the cost of equity capital, offering a unique perspective on equity valuation compared to dividend discount and free cash flow models. By capturing the economic profit generated for shareholders, residual income valuation provides a comprehensive assessment of value creation."
28,"What are the strengths of using residual income models for valuing a company's stock?
   A. Residual income models acknowledge all capital costs and emphasize value creation for shareholders.
   B. Residual income models disregard the company's capital structure.
   C. Residual income models solely focus on accounting profitability.","wer: A
   Explanation: The strengths of residual income models in valuing a company's stock lie in their comprehensive consideration of all capital costs, including the cost of equity, and their emphasis on value creation for common shareholders. By explicitly recognizing the opportunity cost of equity capital, these models provide a robust framework for assessing intrinsic value."
