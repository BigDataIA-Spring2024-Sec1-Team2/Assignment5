 **LOS**: The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach 
 
 **Summary**: The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach is based on the perspective that the equity holders are the residual owners of a company's cash flows after all other claims have been satisfied. This approach focuses on the cash flows available to the equity shareholders after accounting for reinvestment needs and debt holders' claims. The FCFE is calculated as:

\[
FCFE = Net Income - Net Capital Expenditure - Change in Net Working Capital + Net Borrowing
\]

This perspective underscores the idea that equity holders are entitled to the cash flows remaining after all obligations have been met, reflecting their ownership stake in the company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand the adjustments needed to calculate Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) from the following financial metrics:

1. Net Income
2. Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)
3. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)
4. Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on calculating Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). These are important metrics in financial analysis to evaluate a company's financial performance and ability to generate cash for its investors. The formulas for FCFF and FCFE are typically as follows:

- FCFF = EBIT(1-Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital
- FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital + Net Borrowing

These calculations help in understanding how much cash a company is generating after accounting for its operating expenses, investments, and changes  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:

- Forecasting Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)
- Forecasting Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model with the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) in the context of valuation and investment analysis.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage can impact future Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE). These factors can influence the cash flows available to both debt and equity holders of a company.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on evaluating the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a company’s characteristics 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading include understanding and explaining the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) models. These models are used in valuation to estimate the value of a company based on its future cash flows. The appropriate model to use depends on the characteristics of the company being analyzed.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  estimate a company’s value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s) 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to estimate a company's value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s).  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand the use of sensitivity analysis in Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) valuations. Sensitivity analysis helps in assessing how changes in key input variables impact the valuation results of a company. By varying one input at a time while keeping others constant, analysts can determine the sensitivity of the valuation model to changes in assumptions. This analysis provides insights into the key drivers of value and helps in understanding the potential risks and uncertainties involved in the valuation process.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on describing approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model. 
 
 **Summary**: The main learning outcome from the reading is to understand how to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued using a free cash flow valuation model.
