 **LOS**: The member should be able to: calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market value added 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are focused on the ability to calculate and interpret three key performance measures: residual income, economic value added (EVA), and market value added.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe the uses of residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to describe the uses of residual income models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading material include:

1. Calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model.
2. Comparing value recognition in residual income model with other present value models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain fundamental determinants of residual income 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to understand and explain the fundamental determinants of residual income.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals 
 
 **Summary**: The reading discusses the relationship between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals. It explores how residual income valuation can be used to determine the intrinsic value of a company's stock, which can then be compared to the price-to-book ratio to assess whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. The analysis involves forecasting future fundamentals of a company and using the residual income model to calculate the present value of expected future residual income. This information can then be used to determine the appropriate price-to-book ratio for the stock.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
1. Calculating the intrinsic value of a common stock using a single-stage (constant-growth) residual income model.
2. Interpreting the intrinsic value of a common stock using a multistage residual income model.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome from the reading material is to be able to calculate the implied growth rate in residual income using the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to understand continuing residual income and be able to justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon based on company and industry prospects.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are to compare residual income models with dividend discount models and free cash flow models.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a companyâ€™s common stock 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are as follows:
- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of residual income models.
- Justify the selection of a residual income model to value a company's common stock.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  describe accounting issues in applying residual income models 
 
 **Summary**: The learning outcome of the reading is to be able to describe accounting issues that may arise when applying residual income models in finance.  

 _________ 
 **LOS**:  evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model. 
 
 **Summary**: The reading focuses on using a residual income model to determine if a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued. This model involves calculating the intrinsic value of a stock by considering the present value of future residual incomes. By comparing the calculated intrinsic value to the current market price of the stock, investors can make informed decisions about its valuation.
