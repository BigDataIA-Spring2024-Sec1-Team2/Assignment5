2," **LOS**:  explain the going concern assumption and contrast a going concern value to a liquidation value 
 
 **Summary**: - **Going concern assumption**: This is an accounting principle that assumes a company will continue to operate in the foreseeable future. It implies that the company will not be forced to halt operations or liquidate its assets in the near term.

- **Going concern value**: This is the value of a company when it is assumed to continue its operations as a going concern. It considers the future earning potential and cash flows of the business.

- **Liquidation value**: This is the value of a company's assets if they were to be sold off individually in a liquidation scenario. It is typically lower than the going concern value as it does not take into account the company's future earnings potential.

 **Summary**: The learning outcomes of the reading are:

- Dividends: Payments made by a company to its shareholders out of its profits. Dividends reduce the amount of cash available for the company to reinvest in its operations, which can affect future Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).

- Share repurchases: When a company buys back its own shares from the market. This can impact future FCFF and FCFE by reducing the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share and cash flows per share.

- Share issues: When a company issues new shares to raise capital. This can affect future FCFF and FCFE by diluting ownership and potentially reducing earnings per share and cash

2. Two-stage model: This model incorporates two different growth rates, typically a high growth rate in the initial years followed by a lower stable growth rate. It is suitable for companies transitioning from a high-growth phase to a more stable phase.

3. Three-stage model: This model includes three different growth phases, usually high growth, moderate growth, and stable growth. It is appropriate for companies with complex growth patterns or cyclical

Sensitivity analysis helps assess the impact of changes in key variables or assumptions on the valuation outputs, such as the intrinsic value of a company or its stock price. By varying one input at a time while keeping others constant, sensitivity analysis allows analysts to understand the sensitivity of the valuation model to different factors and to identify the key drivers of value in the analysis.
